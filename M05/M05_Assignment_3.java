/* 16.3 (Traffic lights)
Write a program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green. 
When a radio button is selected, the light is turned on. Only one light can be on at a time (see Figure 16.37a). 
No light is on when the program starts.
Figure 16.37: 
(a) The radio buttons are grouped to let you turn only one light on at a time. 
(b) The program converts miles to kilometers and vice versa. 
(c) The program converts among decimal, hex, and binary numbers.
