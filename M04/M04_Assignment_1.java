/* 20.11 (Match grouping symbols)
A Java program contains various pairs of grouping symbols, such as:
    • Parentheses: ( and )
    • Braces: { and }
    • Brackets: [ and ]
Note the grouping symbols cannot overlap. For example, (a{b)} is illegal.
Write a program to check whether a Java source-code file has correct pairs of grouping symbols.
Pass the source-code file name as a command-line argument.
